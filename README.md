# Purpose of the Project

I have decided to create a movie review site that users can come to the website and search any film to review.

I am aiming to create a website that feels easy to use by being up to date and steamlined.

* As a user, I wouuld like to see other users reviews.
* As a user, I would like to be able to make a review.
* As a user, I would like to see all my reviews.
